Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover meaningful insights. The process involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to understand its structure, trends, and relationships.

Key Tasks
Data Loading

Import the dataset and libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
Inspect the data structure and identify key columns.
Data Understanding

Examine the dataset's shape, column types, and summary statistics.
Identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data entries.
Data Cleaning

Handle missing values by imputation or removal.
Convert categorical variables to numeric (if required).
Remove or handle outliers for a cleaner analysis.
Univariate Analysis

Analyze individual variables to understand their distribution.
Use visualizations like histograms, box plots, and count plots.
Multivariate Analysis

Explore relationships between multiple variables.
Use scatter plots, heatmaps, and grouped bar plots to identify correlations and patterns.
Visualization

Create effective and clean plots to present insights.
Use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Insights and Summary

Summarize findings from the analysis.
Highlight key patterns, trends, or anomalies.
Expected Deliverables
Cleaned Dataset: A dataset ready for further analysis or modeling.
Visualizations: Graphs showing distributions, relationships, and correlations.
Key Insights: A written summary of the analysis.
Python Code: Well-commented code used for analysis.
Example Dataset
For demonstration, the Titanic Dataset is used. Key columns:

Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 or 1).
Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, 3).
Age: Age of the passenger.
Sex: Gender.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Sample Insights
Demographics: Majority of passengers are in the 20â€“40 age group.
Survival Trends: Higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers.
Outliers: Extreme values observed in ticket fares.
